# NCGM Model Implementation with PyTorch

This repository contains the implementation of the NCGM model in PyTorch. NCGM is a neural network model for recognizing the table structure. The model is described in the paper [Neural collaborative graph machines for table structure recognition](https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52688.2022.00449).
